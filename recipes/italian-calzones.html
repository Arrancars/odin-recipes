        <p class="recipe-desc">The calzones are the real deal because
            there is no tomato sauce inside! We eat 
            them once at least once a week.</p>
            <p class ="recipe-desc">Have a
            bowl of tomato of spaghetti sauce on the 
            table for people to top their calzone if 
            desired.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        
        <h2>Dough:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1(.25 ounce) package active
                    dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, plus
                    more for dusting</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                </ul>
                
        <h1>Steps</h1>
          <div class="list"><ol>
                <li><p>Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm 
                    water in a mixing bowl; let sit until foamy,
                    about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, sugar,
                    and salt; mix in 1 cup flour untill smooth.
                    Gradually stir in remaining flour until dough
                    is smooth and workable.</p></li>

                <li><p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
                    Knead dough until elastic, about 5 minutes. Place
                    1 tablespoon olive oil in large bowl; lay dough 
                    in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover and
                    let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 
                    minutes.<p></li>
                    
                <li><p>Make filling: Meanwhile, combine Cheddar cheese, 
                    ricotta cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil leaves 
                    in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate 
                    to chill.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                    Grease a baking sheet.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Punch down dough; divide into 2 equal pieces. 
                    Roll each piece out on a lightly floured surface into 
                    1/8-inch-thick circles. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the
                     cheese and meat filling; fold dough over filling to make
                      a semicircle. Press edges down with the tines of a fork
                      to seal. Brush the top of each calzone with beaten egg 
                      and place on the prepared baking sheet.</p></li>

                <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown,
                     about 30 minutes. Serve hot.</p></li>
